# Dev-friendly cafés in Patras
With more and more remote workers in Patras, we've been hearing more and more often the question:

"Hey, know of any cafés that are good options as a work environment?"

As a developer in Patras, I feel that we should have an answer or more!!

Please feel free to suggest your favourite café by opening a PR or by filing a new issue, so that the collected info can be presented to the public.
